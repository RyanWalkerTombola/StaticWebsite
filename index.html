            <h2>2012 Whatever happend then</h2>
            <p>(placeholder text) In early 2002, Elon Musk was seeking staff for his new space company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached rocket 
                engineer Tom Mueller (later SpaceX's CTO of Propulsion) and Mueller agreed to work for Musk, and thus SpaceX was born. SpaceX was first 
                headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California. The company has grown rapidly since it was founded in 2002, growing from 160 
                employees in November 2005 to 1,100 in 2010, 3,800 employees and contractors by October 2013, nearly 5,000 by late 2015, and 
                about 6,000 in April 2017. As of November 2017, the company had grown to nearly 7,000. In 2016, Musk gave a speech at the 
                International Astronautical Congress, where he explained that the US government regulates rocket technology as an "advanced weapon 
                technology", making it difficult to hire non-Americans.</p>
