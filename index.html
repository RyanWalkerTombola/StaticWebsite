            <h2>2012 Title Goes Here</h2>
            <p>(placeholder text) In early 2002, Elon Musk was seeking staff for his new space company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached rocket 
                engineer Tom Mueller (later SpaceX's CTO of Propulsion) and Mueller agreed to work for Musk, and thus SpaceX was born. SpaceX was first 
                headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California. The company has grown rapidly since it was founded in 2002, growing from 160 
                employees in November 2005 to 1,100 in 2010, 3,800 employees and contractors by October 2013, nearly 5,000 by late 2015, and 
                about 6,000 in April 2017. As of November 2017, the company had grown to nearly 7,000. In 2016, Musk gave a speech at the 
                International Astronautical Congress, where he explained that the US government regulates rocket technology as an "advanced weapon 
                technology", making it difficult to hire non-Americans.</p>

                <h2>2001 An idea was Born</h2>
                <p>In 2001, Elon Musk conceptualized the Mars Oasis project, he had plans to take an experimental greenhouse to Mars in an attempt to 
                    regain public interest in space exploration. "This would be the furthest that life's ever traveled" Musk tried to buy cheap rockets from
                    Russia but couldn't find any for an affordable price. On the flight home, Musk realised he could start a company that could build the 
                    affordable rockets he needed. Musk calculated that the raw material cost of a conventional rocket was only 3% of the sale price, by
                    applying vertical intergration, producing 85% of launch hardware in-house, and the modual approach from software engineering, he
                    could cut the launch price by a factor of 10 and still enjoy a 70% gross margin.</p>
